Uno Card Detection System using Computer Vision
1. Introduction
The Uno Card Detection System aims to develop a computer vision solution for detecting and classifying Uno cards from images captured using a smartphone camera. The system will utilize image processing techniques, data augmentation, and machine learning models to accurately detect the cards and classify their attributes such as color and number.

2. Objectives
Develop a dataset containing images of Uno cards captured from a smartphone camera.
Implement image processing techniques to preprocess the images and extract the Uno cards.
Augment the dataset by applying shape transformation and color augmentation to the extracted card images.
Train a regression convolutional neural network (CNN) model to detect the region of interest (ROI) of the Uno cards.
Train a CNN model to classify the numbers and special characters on the Uno cards.
Train a color classifier using a K-nearest neighbors (KNN) model to classify the color of the Uno cards.
3. Methodology
    3.1 Dataset Collection
    The dataset will be collected by capturing images of Uno cards using a smartphone camera. The images will be manually annotated to specify the location of each card in the image.
    
    3.2 Image Preprocessing
    Image preprocessing techniques such as filtering, dilation, and morphological operations will be applied to extract the Uno cards from the background. The images will be cropped to isolate individual cards.
    
    3.3 Data Augmentation
    The cropped card images will undergo shape transformation and color augmentation to increase the diversity of the dataset. Geometric transformations will be applied to simulate variations in card orientation and perspective. Additionally, color augmentation will be performed to simulate variations in lighting conditions and card appearance.
    
    3.4 ROI Detection
    A regression CNN model will be trained to detect the region of interest (ROI) of the Uno cards within the images. The model will predict the bounding box coordinates of each card in the image.
    
    3.5 Number Classification
    A CNN model will be trained to classify the numbers and special characters on the Uno cards. The model will learn to recognize the different symbols present on the cards.
    
    3.6 Color Classification
    A K-nearest neighbors (KNN) model will be trained to classify the color of the Uno cards. The model will use the color information extracted from the cards to classify them into different color categories.
